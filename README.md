# Female Diabetes Prediction Model

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in females using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Overview

This project utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the predictive model. The dataset used for training and testing involves various health parameters of females, aiming to predict the presence or absence of diabetes. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Female_Diabetes_Prediction_Model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and test the SVM model for predicting diabetes in females.
